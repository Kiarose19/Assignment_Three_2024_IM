                <h4>Essay on Net/Web Art</h4>
                <p>Web art also known as net art, short for internet art, is a genre of contemporary </p>
                <p>that took rise in the 90s. This type of art makes use of the internet as a medium in</p>
                <p>which the art is created, exhibited, and distributed to the public. Web/net art included</p>
                <p>a range of artistic practices that made use of different aspects of the internet like</p>
                <p>online forums, websites, social media, and interactive platforms. (Chatel, 2019) This</p>
                <p>orm of art challenged traditional art forms like painting on a canvas because of how</p>
                <p>different the medium used to create it was. Unlike traditional art forms being fixed in</p>
                <p>space and time, the art of the internet was continuously shared, changed and distributed</p>
                <p>providing access to people worldwide. It brought about an innovative and unique way of</p>
                <p>creating art that changed the trajectory of how art was made, displayed, interacted with </p>
                <p>and viewed. (Chatel, 2019).</p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>the internet art piece that I will be analysing is the ‘Starry Night’ interface launched by Rhizome. (Carrier, 2020)</p>
                <p>It was developed by Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe, and Martin Wattenberg as an artistic </p>
                <p>interface for the Rhizome’s email discussion list. This was
a significant forum for artists </p>
                <p>who were working with new forms of art and media in
the nineties. (StarryNight, 1999)</p>
                <p>How this artwork came to be, was that each email in the archive was
represented by a glowing dot of bright light against a dark background, hat would
increase in strength of brightness every time that its corresponding message was
interacted with in the archive.</p>
                <p>The people who used this forum could navigate among
all the messages using keywords that were specifically assigned to those messages
which would then draw constellations connecting similar or related emails in the
database. </p>
                <p>This piece is also quite interactive as it allows users to click on the bright
dots which would bring up the option to read the message or select a keyword
instead that is associated with the message.</p>
                <p>The current work that exists does not
contain all the information that it did ten years ago, because of a loss of data that
occurred therefore, it is not as data heavy as it was created to be. (StarryNight,
1999)</p>
            </div>

            <div className="essay3">
                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>The main theme behind this internet artwork is that of space, which includes stars</p>
                <p>and constellations. Each time a message was added to the list a dot of light </p>
                <p>would
appear adding to the creation of a night sky full of stars. The main reason</p>
                <p>that this is
possible is because the medium used to create this art piece is the internet.</p>
                <p>The
internet provided the creators the opportunity to build an interactive and innovative</p>
                <p>piece like this by means of coding languages like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS - </p>
                <p>where HTML was used to create the structure of the page, JavaScript was used to</p>
                <p>add interactivity and dynamic behaviour, and CSS was used to style the visual</p>
                <p>elements of this artwork - which would have been used to design, implement, and</p>
                <p>style this interactive piece. (StarryNight, 1999).</p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>As mentioned above, the
interface is most definitely interactive as it allows users to mouse over the ‘’stars’’
and when they do a pop-up message appears that invites the users to take further
action so that they may learn more about the many emails/texts that make up this
artwork. </p>
                <p>This only came to fruition through making use of the affordances of the
internet like coding languages. In a similar way, the dots of light getting brighter
when users interact with them is another way that the developers of this art piece
included interactivity, by means of the web technologies (the coding languages)
mentioned above. (StarryNight, 1999)</p>
                <p>All the components that make up the ‘Starry
Night’ interface show how heavily influential the use of the internet as its medium
was, in creating a piece that provided its users with control over what emails/texts
they interacted with as well as which ones they gravitated more towards. </p>
                <p>Without
making use of the internet and its many features, this art piece would not have been
interactive or accessible to the global public because it was the use of code that
made it interactive and accessible to people all over the world. This is like if one
takes away the canvas from a painting, the painting then ceases to exist. (Chatel,
2019).</p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>As a result of its expansive interactivity and taking inspiration from Vincent van</p>
                <p>Gogh’s ‘Starry Night’ painting, his artwork evokes a deep sense of meaning and</p>
                <p>emotion to and within its audience (the users). (Erkan, 2020) However, this artwork</p>
                <p>despite not making use of the vibrant colours and textures in the famous van Gogh</p>
                <p>painting, still emits a sense of wonder and awe within the user because it depicts </p>
                <p>the
night sky full of stars. The reason it evokes such awe and wonder within users is</p>
                <p>because a starry night sky has always been fascinating to people as well as regularly</p>
                <p>observed for its cosmic beauty. This particular artwork depicts how regular things like</p>
                <p>emails can be turned into beautiful and innovative art. </p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>The most important reason of 
                why this creates meaning and evokes emotion though is because of the interactivity
                itself that this art
piece provides to its users. In this artwork, not all users would interact 
with the same “stars” as others or in the same order therefore experiencing 
unique encounters with the art.</p>
                <p>Delving deeper into the aesthetic aspects of the ‘Starry Night’ interface is just as
important as the technical aspects of the artwork because it forms the composition
and aids in making the artwork visually pleasing.</p>
                <p>The aesthetics are the main reason
I chose to analyse this piece. The dark blue/black background reminds one of the
night skies providing a blank canvas for the bright white dots of different sizes to truly
stand out and grab the user’s attention. (StarryNight, 1999) </p>
                <p>The vast number of dots
placed on the background leads one’s mind to the awe and wonder that a night sky
full of stars elicits. In its absolute simplicity in colours and imagery, this artwork still
manages to grasp the attention of the users and evoke curiosity within them of what
this artwork could possibly represent as well as do.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div className="essay7">
                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>When I first interacted with this
art piece my interest was piqued when I realized that </p>
                <p>each star represented an
email/text that came with related keywords which when </p>
                <p>clicked changed and formed
new constellations from the previous. My interest did not</p>
                <p>drop despite knowing all
that the stars represented were just emails/texts and keywords. </p>
                <p>The reason for this is
that all the visuals within this artwork, specifically the uniquely </p>
                <p>shaped constellations,
elicited this feeling of being rewarded because when I clicked </p>
                <p>on a certain word, that
click formed a constellation. Therefore, the visuals play an</p>
                <p>important role in this
artwork as they are the main components that make the work</p>
                <p>aesthetically pleasing,
elicit emotion, and convey to the user that their interaction with  </p>
<p>the artwork is being
registered. (StarryNight, 1999).</p>

                <h4>The Conclusion</h4>
                <p>The analysis of the ‘Starry Night’ interface artwork firstly explains how innovative and
creative a medium the internet can be in creating artworks that are meaningful and
interactive. Secondly, this analysis conveys that when wanting to create an artwork
on the internet, the internet itself is going to play a significant role in how the artwork
is created, how interactive it is, as well as how it is viewed and received by users.</p>
                <p>For example, if one wants to create a digital copy of van Gogh’s painting the ‘Starry
Night’ but make it interactive in that users can click the clouds and stars to change
their colours or sizes, they will need to implore the use of certain components of the
internet like different coding languages to build such an artwork.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, and
specifically with the ‘Starry Night’ interface artwork it can be understood that
aesthetics and the system of the artwork, work dependently on each other to create
the final product that the users get to engage with. (StarryNight, 1999) This
dependency also assists in evoking an emotional response from the users. </p>
                <p>Lastly,
this analysis displays how internet art although advanced and innovative does not
rank particularly higher in stature or importance when compared to traditional art.
Each of these art forms both come with advantages and disadvantages however,
internet art is still viewed as innovative and interesting because, it is a new method
of creating art placing the art and the artist in a new space where the artist does not
take on the position of the observer anymore but, interacts with the art and internet
just how any other person would. (Chatel, 2019).

                <h4>The Proposal for My Internet Artwork</h4>
                <p>The main theme that I have chosen is the scuderia Ferrari formula one team as can </p>
                <p>be seen throughout my website. Therefore I have two ideas that I could try for my </p>
                <p>internet artwork. The first idea takes inspiration from the redbull F1 website. A car, </p>
                <p>the Ferrari, would be able to do a 360 degree rotation with input from the users </p>
                <p>clicking on arrows. This would provide the users with a full, detailed view of the car. </p>
                <p>Another feature I would add to this artwork that the redbull one makes use of too, </p>
                <p>is allowing the users to click on the significant parts of the car and in response to </p>
                <p>that interaction, having information and a close up image of that part pop up.</p>
                <p> This would be a creative way for users to engage with the car well gaining </p>
                <p>interesting knowledge of it too.</p>

            <h4>The Proposal for My Internet Artwork</h4>
                <p>The second idea I had takes inspiration from a tiktok game that I played where I had to click the screen as soon as it turned green. This was to measure one’s reaction time. Incorporating this concept into formula one, I thought that making a game where the user had to click in order the tyres of the Ferrari as fast as they could to win would be an exciting way to allow the user to gain more understanding of what happens in F1 and specifically a pitstop. </p>
                <p>This game would mimic a pitstop by getting the users to get the fastest time possible so that they win the game. A slower reaction time would make them lose. This game would be an intriguing as well as an exciting way to keep users entertained and determined to beat their own scores. This would keep them on the site longer and compel them to interact with the rest of the site.</p>
