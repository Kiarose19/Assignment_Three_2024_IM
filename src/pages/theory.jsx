                <h4>Essay on Net/Web Art</h4>
                <p><span>Web art</span> also known as <span>net art</span>, short for <span>internet art</span>, is a genre of <span>contemporary art</span> </p>
                <p>that took <span>rise</span> in the <span>90s</span>. This type of <span>art</span> makes use of the <span>internet as a medium</span> in</p>
                <p>which the <span>art is created, exhibited</span>, and <span>distributed</span> to the public. <span>Web/net art</span> included</p>
                <p>a <span>range of artistic practices</span> that made use of <span>different aspects</span> of the <span>internet</span> like</p>
                <p>online forums, websites, social media, and interactive platforms. (Chatel, 2019) This</p>
                <p>form of art <span>challenged traditional art forms</span> like painting on a canvas because of how</p>
                <p>different the medium used to create it was. Unlike traditional art forms being fixed in</p>
                <p>space and time, the <span>art</span> of the <span>internet</span> was continuously <span>shared, changed and distributed</span></p>
                <p><span>providing access</span> to people <span>worldwide</span>. It brought about an <span>innovative</span> and <span>unique</span> way of</p>
                <p><span>creating art</span> that <span>changed</span> the trajectory of <span>how art was made, displayed, interacted</span> with </p>
                <p>and <span>viewed</span>. (Chatel, 2019).</p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>the <span>internet art piece</span> that I will be <span>analysing</span> is the <span>‘Starry Night’ interface</span> launched by </p>
                <p><span>Rhizome</span>. (Carrier, 2020)It was <span>developed</span> by <span>Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe</span>, and <span>Martin</span>  </p>
                <p><span>Wattenberg</span> as an <span>artistic interface</span> for the <span>Rhizome’s email discussion list</span>. This was
                 a  </p>
                <p>significant forum for artists who were working with new forms of art and media in
                the </p>
                <p>nineties. (StarryNight, 1999) How this artwork came to be, was that each <span>email</span> in the 
                    <p>archive was <span>represented</span> by a <span>glowing dot of bright light</span> against a <span>dark background</span>,</p>
                    <p>that would
                    <span>increase</span> in <span>strength of brightness</span> every time that its <span>corresponding message</span> </p>
 
                    was <span>interacted with</span> in the archive. The people who used this forum could <span>navigate among</span></p>
                <p>
                    <p>all the <span>messages</span> using <span>keywords</span> that were <span>specifically assigned</span> to those <span>messages</span></p>
 
               which would then <span>draw constellations</span> connecting similar or related emails in the
               database. </p>
                <p>This piece is also quite <span>interactive</span> as it allows users to <span>click</span> on the bright
               dots which 
               <p>would bring up the <span>option to read</span> the <span>message</span> or <span>select a keyword</span> instead that is associated </p>
              <p>with the message. The current work that exists does not
              contain all the information </p>
              </p>
               <p>that it did ten years ago, because of a loss of data that
                 occurred therefore, it is not as</p>
                <p>   data heavy as it was created to be. (StarryNight,
              1999)</p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>The <span>main theme behind</span> this <span>internet artwork</span> is that of <span>space</span>, which includes <span>stars</span></p>
                <p>and <span>constellations</span>. Each time a message was added to the list a dot of light </p>
                <p>would
appear adding to the creation of a night sky full of stars. The main reason</p>
                <p>that this is
possible is because the <span>medium used</span> to create this <span>art piece</span> is the <span>internet</span>.</p>
                <p>The
internet provided the creators the opportunity to <span>build an interactive</span> and <span>innovative</span></p>
                <p>piece like this by means of <span>coding languages</span> like <span>HTML, JavaScript</span>, and <span>CSS</span> - </p>
                <p>where <span>HTML</span> was used to create the <span>structure of the page</span>, <span>JavaScript</span> was used to</p>
                <p>add <span>interactivity and dynamic behaviour</span>, and <span>CSS</span> was used to <span>style the visual</span></p>
                <p>elements of this artwork - which would have been used to design, implement, and</p>
                <p>style this interactive piece. (StarryNight, 1999).</p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>As mentioned above, the
interface is most <span>definitely interactive</span> as it allows <span>users</span> to
<p> <span>mouse over</span> the <span>‘’stars’’</span>
and when they do a <span>pop-up message appears</span> that invites </p>
the users to take <span>further action</span> so that they may learn more about the many emails/ </p>
<p>texts that make up this
artwork. This only came to <span>fruition through</span> making use of the </p>
<p> <span>affordances</span> of the <span>internet</span> like <span>coding languages</span>. In a similar way, the dots of light</p>
<p>getting brighter when users interact with them is another way that the developers of </p>
<p>this art piece included interactivity, by means of the web technologies (the coding </p>
<p>languages) mentioned above. (StarryNight, 1999) All the <span>components</span> that make up </p>
<p> the <span>‘Starry Night’ interface </span>show how <span>heavily influential</span> the <span>use</span> of the <span>internet</span> as its</p>
 <p>medium was, in <span>creating a piece</span> that provided its users with <span>control over</span> what </p>
<p><span>emails/texts</span> they <span>interacted</span> with as well as which ones they <span>gravitated more towards.</span></p>
                <p>Without
making use of the internet and its many features, this art piece would not have 
<p>been interactive or accessible to the global public because it was the <span>use of code</span> that</p>
made it <span>interactive</span> and <span>accessible</span> to people all over the <span>world</span>. This is like if one
</p>
<p>takes away the canvas from a painting, the painting then ceases to exist. (Chatel,
    2019).</p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>As a <span>result</span> of its <span>expansive interactivity</span> and taking <span>inspiration</span> from <span>Vincent van</span></p>
                <p><span>Gogh’s ‘Starry Night’ painting</span>, his <span>artwork evokes</span> a <span>deep sense</span> of <span>meaning</span> and</p>
                <p><span>emotion</span> to and within its <span>audience</span> (the users). (Erkan, 2020) However, this <span>artwork</span></p>
                <p>despite not making use of the vibrant colours and textures in the famous van Gogh</p>
                <p>painting, still <span>emits</span> a <span>sense of wonder</span> and <span>awe</span> within the user because it <span>depicts</span> </p>
                <p>the
<span>night sky full of stars</span>. The reason it <span>evokes</span> such <span>awe and wonder</span> within users is</p>
                <p>because a <span>starry night sky</span> has always been <span>fascinating to people</span> as well as regularly</p>
                <p>observed for its <span>cosmic beauty</span>. This particular artwork depicts how regular things like</p>
                <p>emails can be turned into beautiful and innovative art. </p>

                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>The <span>most important reason</span> of  why this <span>creates meaning</span> and <span>evokes emotion</span> though is</p>
                
                <p>because of the <span>interactivity itself</span> that this <span>art piece provides</span> to its users. In this artwork,</p>
  <p> <span>not all users</span> would <span>interact</span> with the <span>same “stars”</span> as <span>others</span> or in the same order therefore</p>
<p>experiencing <span>unique encounters</span> with the <span>art</span>. Delving deeper into the aesthetic aspects</p>
                <p> of the ‘Starry Night’ interface is just as important as the technical aspects of the artwork </p>
<p>because it forms the composition and aids in making the artwork visually pleasing.</p>
                <p>The <span>aesthetics</span> are the <span>main reason</span> I chose to <span>analyse</span> this piece. The <span>dark blue/black</span>  </p>
<p>background reminds one of the <span>night skies providing</span> a <span>blank canvas</span> for the <span>bright white</span> </p>
<p><span>dots</span> of different sizes to truly stand out and grab the user’s attention. (StarryNight, 1999)</p>
                <p>The <span>vast number of dots</span> placed on the <span>background leads</span> one’s mind to the <span>awe</span> and </p>
<p><span>wonder</span> that a <span>night sky full of stars elicits</span>. In its absolute simplicity in colours and </p>
<p>imagery, this artwork still <span>manages to grasp</span> the <span>attention</span> of the <span>users</span> and evoke </p>
<p>curiosity within them of what this artwork could possibly represent as well as do.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div className="essay7">
                <h4>The 'Starry Night' Interface</h4>
                <p>When I first interacted with this
art piece my <span>interest was piqued</span> when I realized that </p>
                <p>each <span>star represented</span> an
<span>email/text</span> that came with <span>related keywords</span> which when </p>
                <p><span>clicked changed</span> and <span>formed</span>
new <span>constellations</span> from the previous. My interest did not</p>
                <p>drop despite knowing all
that the stars represented were just emails/texts and keywords. </p>
                <p>The reason for this is
that all the <span>visuals within this artwork</span>, specifically the <span>uniquely</span> </p>
                <p><span>shaped constellations</span>,
elicited this <span>feeling</span> of being <span>rewarded</span> because when I clicked </p>
                <p>on a certain word, that
<span>click formed a constellation</span>. Therefore, the visuals play an</p>
                <p>important role in this
artwork as they are the main components that make the work</p>
                <p><span>aesthetically pleasing</span>,
<span>elicit emotion</span>, and convey to the user that their <span>interaction with</span>  </p>
<p>the <span>artwork</span> is being
<span>registered</span>. (StarryNight, 1999).</p>

                <h4>The Conclusion</h4>
                <p>The <span>analysis of the ‘Starry Night’ interface artwork</span> firstly explains how <span>innovative</span> and</p>
                <p><span>creative</span> a <span>medium the internet</span> can be in <span>creating artworks</span> that are <span>meaningful</span> and</p>
                <p><span>interactive</span>. Secondly, this analysis <span>conveys</span> that when wanting to create an <span>artwork</span></p>
                <p>on the <span>internet</span>, the <span>internet itself</span> is going to <span>play a significant role</span> in how the artwork</p>
                <p> is created, how interactive it is, as well as how it is viewed and received by users. <span>For</span></p>
                <p> <span>example</span>, if one wants to <span>create</span> a <span>digital copy of van Gogh’s painting</span> the ‘Starry Night’ </p>
                <p>but make it <span>interactive</span> in that users can <span>click the clouds</span> and stars to <span>change their colours</span> </p>
                <p>or sizes, they will need to <span>implore the use</span> of certain components of the <span>internet</span> like </p>
                <p>different <span>coding languages</span> to build such an artwork. Thirdly, and specifically with the </p>
                <p>‘Starry Night’ interface artwork it can be understood that <span>aesthetics</span> and the <span>system</span> of </p>
                <p> the artwork, work <span>dependently</span> on each other to create the final product that the users  </p>
                <p>get to engage with. (StarryNight, 1999) This <span>dependency</span> also assists in <span>evoking</span> an </p>
                <p><span>emotional response</span> from the users. Lastly, this analysis displays how internet art </p>
                <p>although advanced and innovative does not
                rank particularly higher in stature or </p>
                <p>importance when compared to traditional art. Each of these <span>art forms</span> both come with </p>
                <p><span>advantages and disadvantages</span> however, <span>internet art</span> is still viewed as <span>innovative</span> and  </p>
                <p>interesting because, it is a new method of creating art placing the art and the artist in </p>
                <p>a new space where the artist does not take on the position of the observer anymore </p>
                <p>but, interacts with the art and internet just how any other person would. (Chatel, 2019).</p>

                <h4>The Proposal for My Internet Artwork</h4>
                <p>The <span>main theme</span> that I have <span>chosen</span> is the <span>scuderia Ferrari formula one team</span> as can </p>
                <p>be seen throughout my website. Therefore I have <span>two ideas</span> that I could try for my </p>
                <p><span>internet artwork</span>. The <span>first idea</span> takes <span>inspiration</span> from the <span>redbull F1 website</span>. A car, </p>
                <p>the <span>Ferrari</span>, would be able to do a <span>360 degree rotation</span> with <span>input</span> from the <span>users</span> </p>
                <p>clicking on arrows. This would <span>provide the users</span> with a full, <span>detailed view</span> of the <span>car</span>. </p>
                <p>Another feature I would add to this artwork that the redbull one makes use of too, </p>
                <p>is allowing the <span>users to click</span> on the <span>significant parts</span> of the <span>car</span> and in response to </p>
                <p>that interaction, having <span>information</span> and a <span>close up image</span> of that <span>part pop up</span>.</p>
                <p> This would be a creative way for users to engage with the car well gaining </p>
                <p>interesting knowledge of it too.</p>

                <p>to <span>click the screen</span> as soon as it <span>turned green</span>. This was to measure one’s reaction time. </p>
                <p>Incorporating this concept into formula one, I thought that making a <span>game</span> where </p>
                <p>the <span>user had to click</span> in order the <span>tyres of the Ferrari</span> as <span>fast</span> as they could to win would </p>
                <p>be an <span>exciting way</span> to <span>allow the user</span> to gain more <span>understanding</span> of what happens in </p>
                <p><span>F1</span> and specifically a <span>pitstop</span>. This game would mimic a pitstop by getting the users to </p>
                <p>get the fastest time possible so that they win the game. A slower reaction time would </p>
                <p>make them lose. This <span>game</span> would be an <span>intriguing as well as an exciting</span> way to keep </p>
                <p>users <span>entertained</span> and <span>determined</span> to <span>beat their own scores</span>. This would keep them on </p>
                <p>the site longer and compel them to interact with the rest of the site.</p>
